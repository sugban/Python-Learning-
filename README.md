# Installation/Setup

I recommend to work with Anaconda distribution of Python. You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and find installation instructions for Windows, MacOS and Linux [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). <br>
If you already have Python on your computer, that's great!
